## v3.x Key Aims

### Improve system performance and stability
- **1:** Rewrite and separation of ARM UI code from the Ripper code base
- **2:** Following 1, rewrite of the Ripper code base
- **3:** Implementation of pytest (unit testing) against all rewritten code

### Move from docker to docker-compose
- **1:** Update docker build and run files to docker-compose
- **2:** Split the ARM Ripper and ARM UI into separate containers
- **3:** Implement MySQL docker container as a new standalone image
- **4:** Implement container networking between containers

### Move the database from SQLite to MySQL
- **1:** Migrate the current database from SQLite to MySQL
- **2:** Support user migration of existing databases to the new container


## Docker Overview
ARM has been split into three containers, database, UI and ripper, all connected together via the arm-network.
The idea splits out the UI and rippers to allow for future flexiability.
The split allows the UI and ripper(s) to be run on seperate physical machines if a user wants.

All containers are built using docker compose.
Quick generation of containers can be managed from the ARM Dev Tools using the `-dc` option.

### ARM UI
**Overview**:
ARM user interface or web page provides control, configuration and status for all connected rippers.

**Volumes**:
UI only requires access to the /log, /config and /db folders

**Devices**:
No devices are passed into the UI, all device scanning occurs within the ripper container via API calls

### ARM Ripper
**Overview**:
ARM ripper, manages a ripping job from start to finish reporting data back to the database image.

**Volumes**:
Requires access to /transcode, /completed and /logs

**Devices**:
Requires CD, DVD or Blu-ray drives to execute ripping jobs.

### ARM Database
ARM DB is pulled from the mysql:latest, with minimal configuration required.
User, password and database need to align with the values entered into the UI and ripper.
The database only requires a single volume, a local folder for the mysql database to reside.

_Note: The arm-db-test is added for running tests against the database. Avoiding entries into a production database_

### ARM Network
The ARM network is a docker network link, allowing data to pass between the UI, Ripper and Database.
For systems where the ripper, UI and database are on separate machines, additional testing will be required.


## Setup PyCharm for v3.x
PyCharm supports code development and testing, with Docker, MySQL, Flask and Test integration.

### ARM v2.x
Create a new 'Flask Server' configuration.
For easier management, name as 'ARM 2.0' or similar.

Configuration:
- Python 3.10
- Script: /opt/arm/arm/runui.py
- Working directory: /opt/arm/arm
- Environment Variables: None
- Paths to ".env" files: none
- Flask env: development
- Enable EnvFile: not checked

### ARM v3.x
Create a new 'Flask Server' configuration.
For easier management, name as 'ARM 3.0' or similar.

Configuration:
- Python 3.10
- Script: /opt/arm/arm/runui.py
- Working directory: /opt/arm/arm
- Environment Variables:
  - MYSQL_IP=127.0.0.1;MYSQL_PASSWORD=example;MYSQL_USER=arm;FLASK_DEBUG=1;ARM_HOME=/home/arm
- Paths to ".env" files: none
- Flask env: development
- Enable EnvFile: not checked

### ARM Unit Testing - UI
Create a new 'Python tests' configuration.
For easier management, name as 'Test - ARM UI' or similar.

Configuration:
- Python 3.10
- Script: /opt/arm/test_ui
- Additional arguments: none
- Working directory: none
- Environment Variables: none
- Paths to ".env" files: none
- Enable EnvFile: not checked

### ARM Unit Testing - Ripper
Create a new 'Python tests' configuration.
For easier management, name as 'Test - ARM Ripper' or similar.

Configuration:
- TBC

### MySQL Database Configuration
Create a new database connection, under 'Data Sources and Drivers'

Name: arm@localhost (user can define)
Host: localhost
Authentication: User and Password
User: arm
Password: example (same password as Env Variables)
database: arm
url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/arm

## Implementation of Sessions 
Implementation of sessions to be conducted once both the rewrite and docker compose completed

> [!TIP]
> 
> Due to the level of work required, sessions will be rolled out at a later date.
> The base migration ARM 3.x will be rolled out ready for sessions, but not implemented.

Details from Community Discussion - [ARM Sessions for Drives](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/discussions/815)

ARM Default data types - not user editable, based on the current ARM architecture
User Sessions - User editable configuration for sessions, an example set below. User can create, read, update and delete any session

Before starting down the path of implementing this, rather large change, I would like feedback from the ARM users on what they would like in such an update. If you could respond, with any pro's/con's/I can help statements, I will compile them below

**Behaviour**
Edited to add behaviour. These items will be added into the [Project Sessions](https://github.com/orgs/automatic-ripping-machine/projects/6) as tasks for the developers (or anyone) to implement.
The idea with implementing each of these will be a gradual progress towards the ARM sessions.
- ARM default data types will not change, these will be defined within the ARM code base as specific methods of ripping media **[new]**
- ARM User Sessions will be defined within the ARM code base but within the initial database load and configurable by the user to change specific fields as required **[new]**
- Ripping a movie - will rip a movie as the current ARM does **[update]**
- Ripping a TV Show will rip similar to a movie; however, using the session a User will specify the TV series to be ripped and which season is being ripped. Noting that a lot of TV series have strange disk names. Using data from movie database, ARM will use the TV series length to find the number of episodes on the disk and commence ripping. The user will be able to specify which episode the session is starting at, and then the format of the episode naming **[new]**
- Add in TV Series episode name convention. For example SERIES E1E02, Series_s01_e02, or others as defined by the user **[new]**
- Ripping music will be similar to current, but allow for multiple abcde configurations that can rip with different settings, i.e. MP3, FLAC **[new]**
- Ripping media like a home movie, or some other content that needs transcoding but with no media lookup **[new]**
- Ripping/copying data with no media look up or transcoding **[update]**
- Ripping/copying data as an ISO with no media lookup **[update]**

Overview of what some of the settings and sessions could look like.
**ARM Default Data Types**
- DVD: ARM will rip new media as a movie
- Bluray: ARM will rip new media as a blueray movie
- Music: ARM will rip new media as a music
- Data: ARM will rip new media as a data disk (copy contents)
- ISO: ARM will rip new media as an ISO image of the disk

**User Sessions**
- Movie - DVD: ARM session to rip DVD movies - Type: DVD
- Movie - Blueray: ARM sessionto rip Bluray movies - Type: Bluray
- TV - DVD: ARM session to rip DVD TV Series - Type: DVD
- TV - Blueray: ARM session to rip Bluray TV Series - Type: Bluray
- Music - MP3 : ARM session to rip music as mp3 - Type: Music
- Music - flac: ARM session to rip music as flac - Type: Music
- Data: ARM session to rip data disk - Type: Data
- HomeMovie - DVD: ARM session to rip dvd contents but with no title lookup - Type: DVD
- HomeMovie - Bluray: ARM session to rip dvd contents but with no title lookup - Type: Bluray
- ISO: ARM session to create ISO - Type: iso
